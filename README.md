 More practice on JS. The following were implemented:
 Nested functions, DOM(styling DOM elements, showing and hiding DOM elements, passing objects to function) and detecting button clicks

 The project includes 3 buttons which perform the following functions
1. Accepts user input and passes the stored objects as a function
2. Changes the background to specific colors as indicated by the user
3. An accordion that hides a particular element on the page.
